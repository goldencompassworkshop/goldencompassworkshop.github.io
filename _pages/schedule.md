This workshop focuses on four main themes: 
(1) career trajectories and leadership development; 
(2) mentoring and communication; 
(3) wayfinding â€“ obstacles, conflicts, and resolution; and 
(4) work-life integration. 

All discussions center on cultural issues faced by foreign-born scholars. We aim to create a safe space for all participants to share their personal experience and build a supportive professional network. 

The workshop takes place on May 21-22 in Denver, CO.
