This workshop will focus on four main themes: 
(1) career trajectories and leadership development; 
(2) mentoring and communication; 
(3) wayfinding â€“ obstacles, conflicts, and resolution; and 
(4) work-life integration. 

All discussions will center on cultural issues faced by foreign-born scholars. We aim to create a safe space for all participants to share their personal experience and build a supportive professional network. 

The workshop will take place on May 21-22 in Denver, CO. The detailed schedule for this workshop will be available in February. 

_We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation with the highest priority of safety of all our participants._
