This workshop will focus on four main themes: (1) career trajectories and leadership development; (2) mentoring and communication; (3) wayfinding â€“ obstacles, conflicts, and resolution; and (4) work-life integration. All discussions will center on cultural issues faced by foreign-born scholars. We aim to create a safe space for all participants to share their personal experience and build a support network. 

The detailed schedule for this workshop will be available in January. The tentative date is March 27-28 in Denver, CO.
