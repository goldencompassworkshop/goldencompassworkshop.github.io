We are a group of geospatial science faculty who are members or a leader of the Training and Retaining Leaders in STEM - Geospatial sciences ([TRELIS](https://www.ucgis.org/trelis)) program, an NSF-funded traineeship program managed by [UCGIS](https://www.ucgis.org/) and The University of Maine. 

This workshop is partially funded by UCGIS TRELIS through the Carolyn Merry Mini Grant. This grant aims to encourage continued discussion and
personal growth around the TRELIS workshop themes of career trajectories & leadership development, mentoring & coaching, communication & language, 
reaching solutions for obstacles & conflicts, and work-life integration.

This grant program is named in memory of Carolyn Merry, professor emerita of Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering at The Ohio State University 
and former President of UCGIS. Dr. Merry was particularly known for her remarkably strong and effective mentoring of women and junior scholars, and in 
her honor UCGIS also established the Carolyn Merry Mentoring Award in 2016.
