**Lodging:** Hyatt Centric Denver (1776 Champa St, Denver, CO 80202)

From DIA (Denver International Airport): you can take A line RTD from Denver Airport Station. It will take about 40 minutes (or 7 stops) to Union Station (downtown station). The train runs every 15 minutes for $10.50 for a single-ride (see the detailed schedule or fare information here: https://www.rtd-denver.com/).

The workshop will cover the one-night stay (single-occupancy) at Hyatt Centric Denver (checking in May 21, Saturday and checking out May 22, Sunday). For any shoulder night depending on your flight schedule, unfortunately you are responsible for the expense. However, the hotel will offer the same rate for those shoulder nights for your stay (from Friday to Sunday).

Please complete this quick survey (https://forms.gle/x4WFTpTEWx2AmsB57) by April 20 for your travel, including meal accommodation (i.e. special dietary request), so feel free to share your needs.
